My name is **Kitsune Solar**. I am doing various web development and system administration, self taught.

Over the course of my career, I have created and closed many different interesting and not very projects. Most of my projects were aimed at researching web technologies and studying system administration. Someday here I will publish the history of each of them...

This page will be updated from time to time when I have a desire to add something.
